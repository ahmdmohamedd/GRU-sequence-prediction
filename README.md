# GRU-sequence-prediction
This project implements a GRU-based sequence prediction model to forecast the number of air passengers using the famous AirPassengers dataset. The model predicts future values based on historical data, capturing time-series trends. Key steps include data preprocessing, model building, and result visualization.
